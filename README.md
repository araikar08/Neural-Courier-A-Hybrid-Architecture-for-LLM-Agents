ðŸ¤– AI Agent Arena
An interactive AI battle arena where you don't play the characterâ€”you coach the AI.
A submission for the UC Berkeley AI Hackathon 2025, this project explores a new paradigm of gaming and human-AI interaction. Instead of direct control, players provide high-level, natural language strategies (e.g., "be aggressive, hunt for gems") to an autonomous agent. These agents, built on the Fetch.ai framework and powered by large language models, then interpret these commands and battle in a real-time 3D environment built with Nitrode.
