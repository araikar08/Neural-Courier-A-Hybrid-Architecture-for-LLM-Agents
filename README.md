# 🤖 AI Agent Arena

An interactive AI battle arena where you don't play the character — you **coach** the AI.

A submission for the **UC Berkeley AI Hackathon 2025**, this project explores a new paradigm of gaming and human-AI interaction. Instead of direct control, players provide high-level, natural language strategies (e.g., _"be aggressive, hunt for gems"_) to an autonomous agent. 

These agents, built on the **Fetch.ai** framework and powered by **large language models**, then interpret these commands and battle in a real-time 3D environment built with **Nitrode**.
